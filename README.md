# Images: CheckBoard Mask

## What does it do?
The file 'checkmask.py' holds a function that reveals a picture piece by piece, on a particular order, till all 9 pieces are shown. It takes as input: a picture and a digit between 1-9 which stands for the number of piece to show. By varying the number of revealed peaces you can see more or less of the picture. This idea holds as a reference a particular moment of  80's TV television show 'Catch a Phrase'. 

To have an idea of how the show was you can look at the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFhedb2g9jg) :tv:
